<!--About Me-->
<p class = "text">
    My name is Iacopo Turano (03.01.2004), I live somewhere in Ticino (CH). 
    I've studied four years elecronics at the Scuola d'Arti e Mestieri in Bellinzona.
    I've been playing videogames since I was 6, and I'm still playing to these days.
    I'm also passionate about philosophy, psychoanalisys in particular. 
    I'm also part of a writing group, that's also a big passion of mine.
    <br>
    <br>
    Known programming languages: PIC18 Assembly, C, C++, Ruby, now learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 
    My favorite language is C. I love microcontrollers.

<!--About This Website-->
<h2 class = "subtitle">About This Website</h2>
<p class = "text">
    I've started working on this website during 2023 summer holydays with no experience.
    Big thanks to <a class = "hyperlink" href = "https://github.com/paolobettelini">Paolo Bettelini</a>, who helped me understand what I was doing.
    I'm coding this website with HTML and CSS. I'm planning to add some stuff with JavaScript.

    I'm using this space to showcase my projects and my art progresses.

<!--Programming-->
<h2 class = "subtitle">Programming</h2>
<p class = "text">
    I've started programming in C while I was in middle school, my parents bought me an Elegoo pack with an Arduino Uno inside.
    I've messed around with it for almost a year, then Electronics school began. First year of it was pretty much all about
    soldering, so no programming. Second year was when C seriously kicked in. We used a big Arduino Kit to learn how to program
    a microcontroller, we also learned to develop console applications. Third year we (thankfully) abbandoned Arduino in favor
    of the PIC microcontroller family from Microchip. We worked during the entire year on a custom development board with a PIC18F45k22,
    writing more complex C code. Also learned to create custom printed circuit boards using Autodesk EAGLE and a PCB printer.
    The last year we moved on C++ (unfortunatelly) and started developing an UI for said development board.
