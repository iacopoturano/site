    First Perspective Attempt (10.07.2023):
    <br>
    I've tried to draw my room with a one-point perspective. This is my first ever attempt.
    I'll keep trying with this.
    <br>
    <br>
    What's wrong:
    <br>
    I won't use the ruler ever again. <br>
    I won't use the marker ever again. <br>
    I could't follow the vanishing point, this is quite evident. <br>
    The lamp, the chair, the door knob, and other stuff is wrong. <br>
    <br>
    What's right:
    <br>
    I've pretty much got what I'm suppose to do.
    <br>

    Second Perspective Attempt (11.07.2023):
    <br>
    This is the second attempt at doing the same thing.
    <br>
    <br>
    What's wrong:
    <br>
    Pretty much the same things. <br>
    I forgot to ad threedimensionality to some stuff. <br>
    <br>
    What's right:
    <br>
    Added some new details. <br>

    Third Perspective Attempt (12.07.2023):
    <br>
    Since I was having difficulties to draw the shelfs threedimensionality, <a class = "hyperlink" href = "https://www.instagram.com/cr_1s1/">cr_1s1</a>
    suggested me to draw a close-up of them. This really helped me.
    <br>
    <br>
    What's wrong:
    <br>
    It looks strange because of the wrong proportions all over the place.
    For this reason I'm going to work on proportions next.
    I'll eventually come back to the room exercise since I'd like to add more details. <br>
    <br>
    What's right:
    <br>
    Perspective wise, it's probably the best result so far. <br>
