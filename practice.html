    First Perspective Attempt (09.07.2023):
    <br>
    I've tried to draw my room with a one-point perspective. This is my first ever attempt.
    I'll keep trying with this.
    <br>
    <br>
    What's wrong:
    <br>
    I won't use the ruler ever again. <br>
    I won't use the marker ever again. <br>
    I could't follow the vanishing point, this is quite evident. <br>
    The lamp, the chair, the door knob, and other stuff is wrong. <br>
    <br>
    What's right:
    <br>
    I've pretty much got what I'm suppose to do.
